Demonic city character card generator, written in Angular. The text is in spanish because is the main population of the forum.
This was my first Angular project, so is a bit of a mess and pretty hardcoded in some places.

Is intended to be used within an iframe, so can be placed in a post.
You can do whatever you want with all the cards that says "Aztic", the other ones, if you use them, give credits to [Aquino](https://www.facebook.com/daquinoblanco), i just made this "above those".

## Why do this?
I frequent role-playing forums, which uses ForoActive (if im right, the equivalent in english is "ForuMotion") and allows (for some reason) posts using html/css. This makes the users to want to make "fancy" character cards and such.

Since i always wanted to to something like this, serves as practice and can be helpfull to a friend's forums, i made this.
